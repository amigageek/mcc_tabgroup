Description
-----------

MCCLib serves as a basis for writing public MUI Custom Classes including
preference classes. It is a competitor to "mccheader.c" giving a custom
class developer the basic library initialization code.

MCCLib features:

- Supports 68000-68060 including FPUs
- Automatically generates version-string including copyright and CPU
  information
- Supports preference classes including preference images
- Easier to use than mccheader.c
- Well formatted/readable source code
- Works with SAS/C® and GCC 2.7.2.1
- Is prepared for working with StormC, Maxon C++, DICE C 3.x, VBCC, Aztec C
  and Lattice C


To compile a MCC/MCP with SAS/C® use the following compiler options as an
example:
sc opt strict ansi commentnest noicons nolink math=standard nostackcheck \
   nostkext strmer memsize=huge def=__MakeLib objname=MyClass_mcc.o \
   MyClass_mcc.c
slink MyClass_mcc.o to MyClass.mcc noicons sc sd lib lib:amiga.lib lib:sc.lib


GCC developers, please be careful - it is not possible to compile with
"-fbaserel" (a4 relative compiling)!
A4 relative compiling fails since there are too many registers used in
UserLipOpen/MUI_CreateCustomClass.
To create a Style Guide conform versionstring date, please define __AMIGADATE__
with the following tool which can be found on Aminet CD5 or SET1a:
Aminet:dev/c/AmigaDate.lha

To compile a MCC/MCP with GCC use the following compiler options as an example:
gcc -noixemul -nostdlib -nostartfiles -IMUI:Developer/C/include -s -O2 \
    -msmall-code -o MyClass.mcc MyClass_mcc.c -lnix -lgcc -lamiga



Requirements
------------

- MUI 3.1 Developer
- SAS/C® or GCC 2.7.2.1



Installation
------------

Copy the Developer/C/Examples/MCCLib.c file to wherever you want - it is
recommended to copy it into your include path.
